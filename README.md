# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It showcases the projects I've worked on and the technologies I'm proficient in.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion (animation package, used for page transitions)

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, use the following commands:
npm install  
npm run dev

The app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to make the following updates:

- Redesign the entire website to make it better looking
- Create a "Technologies" page where users can see a list of the technologies I'm proficient in and the projects where I've used them. This page will include details about my level of knowledge of each technology
